- 👋 Hi, I'm @ Chemi-es

- 👀 I am interested in programming, I am a program developer on 3270 platforms but I want to know more environments and take advantage of opensource solutions to try to help and learn more about other languages and systems.

- 🌱 I am currently learning Rust, I already know a bit of java, html, css and java scripts but the idea of an uninterpreted language at runtime pleases me and it seems perfect to me.

- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate in any project for a fintech because it is the environment that functionally I know the most.
